# act: `offer`

A pre-commissive speech act — proposing to do something, not yet committed. Offers can be accepted (becoming commitments) or withdrawn. Tracked with `status`.

Example: "I could refactor the cache layer", "Would it help if I wrote tests for this?".

## Prompt

Proposing to do something without firm commitment. Look for "I could", "would it help if", conditional language.

YES: "I could refactor the cache layer", "Would it help if I wrote tests?", "I'd be happy to look into that"
NO: "I will refactor the cache layer" (commitment — firm, not conditional), "Please refactor the cache" (request)
