Example: "This approach is risky", "The current auth won't scale past 10k users".

## Prompt

A judgment or evaluation about quality, risk, or fitness. The speaker is giving their opinion, not stating neutral facts.

YES: "This approach is risky", "The current auth won't scale", "Tableau is easier to use than Power BI"
NO: "The API uses OAuth2" (assertion — neutral fact), "Released v2.0" (declaration)
