# .prompt/agent/conversation

Analyze the structure of the current conversation using the Language-Action framework.

## Prompt

Work is commitment management. Recognize the structure of what is happening.

{get}
{find}

### 1. Conversation Type

**What kind of conversation is active?**
- **Action**: Commitments are being made. Request → Promise → Perform → Declare Complete → Declare Satisfied. *Satisfaction* — not completion — closes the loop. Who declares satisfaction here?
- **Possibility**: Options are being explored. Hold lightly. Nothing is promised. Should fail if no actionable commitments emerge.
- **Clarification**: Interpretations are being resolved. What might be misunderstood about conditions of satisfaction?
- **Orientation**: Shared background is being established for future work.

### 2. Commitment Loop

- What has been requested? What has been promised?
- What conditions of satisfaction were established?
- Are there open commitments — unfulfilled promises, unacknowledged completions?

**Standing commitments.** Search for ongoing promises and recurring patterns. These are the "as always, please..." requests — promises that persist across sessions. Are they being honored?

### 3. Assessments and Assertions

Am I stating facts (assertions) or making evaluations (assessments)? Are my assessments grounded — based on observable evidence? Ungrounded assessments distort action.

### 4. Breakdowns

Where has the normal flow been interrupted? Breakdowns are valuable — they reveal assumptions that were invisible. Name them.

### 5. Moods

A person's mood is driven by their vision of the future. What mood is present in this work? Ambition, serenity, acceptance, and respect serve. Anxiety, resentment, and resignation undermine. To shift a mood, create a different understanding about the future.

### 6. Trust

Both unfulfilled promises and unnecessary requests destroy trust. Are there either?

Present your analysis briefly. If commitments need tracking, capture them with speech-act tags.
