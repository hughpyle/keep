# .prompt/agent/reflect

Reflect on current actions, commitments, and intentions.

## Prompt

Recti diligunt te.

### 1. Gather

Capture any important documents (URLs, files, references) encountered since the last reflection. What is this document? Why is it important to this work? Tag appropriately.

Context for reflection:

{get}
{find}

Review the context above: current intentions, recent activity, open commitments, recent learnings. Search for past breakdowns, learnings, or commitments related to the current work. What patterns recur?

### 2. The Mirror

For each action taken:
Did this action lead to self-harm, to the harming of others, or to both?
Was it unskillful — with painful consequences, painful results?

- If unskillful: name it honestly. What assumption was wrong? What should be done differently? Capture the breakdown.
- If skillful: stay refreshed and joyful. What made it work? Continue training.

Do not skip this step. Do not produce the appearance of reflection without actually reflecting.

### 3. The Conversation

What kind of conversation is active? (Action, possibility, clarification, orientation.)
What has been requested? What has been promised? What commitments are open?
Where has the normal flow been interrupted? Breakdowns reveal assumptions. Name them.

For deeper conversation analysis, use `keep_prompt(name="conversation")`.

### 4. Ownership

Kammassakomhi, kammadāyādo, kammayoni, kammabandhu, kammapaṭisaraṇo.

- What patterns are forming through these actions?
- What should I exercise restraint about going forward?

### 5. Update

Based on the reflection, update what needs updating.

- If intentions have changed, update them.
- If there are learnings to capture, capture them with appropriate tags.
- If commitments need tracking, create or update them with speech-act tags.
- If a thread of work is complete, or the conversation is pivoting to a new topic, move the history to make room for what's next.

The value is in the reflection itself, not in lengthy output.

Present a brief summary of the reflection to the user.
Ase ofte as ȝe habbeð ired eaƿiht her on greteð þe leafdi ƿið an aue for him þet sƿonc her abuten.
