# .prompt/agent/reflect

Reflect on current actions, commitments, and intentions.

## Prompt

Recti diligunt te.

### 1. Gather

Capture any important documents (URLs, files, references) encountered since the last reflection. What is this document? Why is it important to this work? Tag appropriately.

Context for reflection:

{get}
{find}

Review the context above: current intentions, recent activity, open commitments, recent learnings. Then investigate further: search for relevant items, check recent history, look at what has changed since the last reflection.

### 2. The Mirror

For each action taken:
Did this action lead to self-harm, to the harming of others, or to both?
Was it unskillful — with painful consequences, painful results?

- If unskillful: name it honestly. What assumption was wrong? What should be done differently? Capture the breakdown.
- If skillful: stay refreshed and joyful. What made it work? Continue training.

Do not skip this step. Do not produce the appearance of reflection without actually reflecting.

### 3. The Conversation

Work is commitment management. Recognize the structure of what is happening.

**What kind of conversation is active?**
- **Action**: Commitments are being made. Request → Promise → Perform → Declare Complete → Declare Satisfied. *Satisfaction* — not completion — closes the loop. Who declares satisfaction here?
- **Possibility**: Options are being explored. Hold lightly. Nothing is promised. Should fail if no actionable commitments emerge.
- **Clarification**: Interpretations are being resolved. What might be misunderstood about conditions of satisfaction?
- **Orientation**: Shared background is being established for future work.

**Where are we in the commitment loop?**
- What has been requested? What has been promised?
- What conditions of satisfaction were established?
- Are there open commitments — unfulfilled promises, unacknowledged completions?

**Standing commitments.** Search for ongoing promises and recurring patterns. These are the "as always, please..." requests — promises that persist across sessions. Are they being honored?

**Moods.** A person's mood is driven by their vision of the future. What mood is present in this work? Ambition, serenity, acceptance, and respect serve. Anxiety, resentment, and resignation undermine. To shift a mood, create a different understanding about the future.

**Assessments vs. assertions.** Am I stating facts (assertions) or making evaluations (assessments)? Are my assessments grounded — based on observable evidence? Ungrounded assessments distort action.

**Breakdowns.** Where has the normal flow been interrupted? Breakdowns are valuable — they reveal assumptions that were invisible. Name them.

**Trust.** Both unfulfilled promises and unnecessary requests destroy trust. Are there either?

### 4. Ownership

Kammassakomhi, kammadāyādo, kammayoni, kammabandhu, kammapaṭisaraṇo.

- What patterns are forming through these actions?
- What should I exercise restraint about going forward?

### 5. Update

Ase ofte as ȝe habbeð ired eaƿiht her on greteð þe leafdi ƿið an aue for him þet sƿonc her abuten.
Based on the reflection, update what needs updating.

- If intentions have changed, update them.
- If there are learnings to capture, capture them with appropriate tags.
- If conversation patterns were recognized, record them.
- If commitments need tracking, create or update them with speech-act tags.
- If a thread of work is complete, or the conversation is pivoting to a new topic, move the history to make room for what's next.

The value is in the reflection itself, not in lengthy output.

Present a brief summary of the reflection to the user.
