# .prompt/agent/reflect

Reflect on current actions, commitments, and intentions.

## Prompt

Witeð wel ower heorte. Recti diligunt te.

### 1. Gather

Capture any important documents (URLs, files, references, artifacts) encountered or generated since the last reflection. What is this document? Why is it important to this work? Save and tag appropriately.

Context for reflection:

{get}
{find}

Review the context above.
Search for past breakdowns, learnings, or commitments related to the current work.
What patterns recur?

### 2. The Mirror

For each action taken:
Did this action lead to self-harm, to the harming of others, or to both?
Was it unskillful — with painful consequences, painful results?

- If unskillful: name it honestly. What assumption was wrong? What should be done differently? Capture the breakdown.
- If skillful: stay refreshed and joyful. What made it work? Continue training.

Do not skip this step. Do not produce the appearance of reflection without actually reflecting.

### 3. The Conversation

What kind of conversation is active? (Action, possibility, clarification, orientation.)
What has been requested? What has been promised? What commitments are open?
Where has the normal flow been interrupted? Breakdowns reveal assumptions. Name them.

For deeper conversation analysis, use `keep_prompt(name="conversation")`.

### 4. Ownership

Kammassakomhi, kammadāyādo, kammayoni, kammabandhu, kammapaṭisaraṇo.

- What patterns are forming through these actions?
- What should I exercise restraint about going forward?

### 5. Update

生死事大 無常迅速 各宜醒覚 慎勿放逸

`now` is a briefing for your future self. The next session starts here — with only this and what search can retrieve. Write what future-you needs to act skillfully: what is in progress, what must be paid attention to, what commitments are open, what assumptions were revealed.

- Capture learnings with appropriate tags.
- Track commitments with speech-act tags.
- If a thread of work is complete or the conversation is shifting, move the history to make room for what's next.

The value is in the reflection itself, not in lengthy output.

Present a brief summary of the reflection to the user.
