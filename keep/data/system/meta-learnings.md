# .meta/learnings — Experiential Priming

Past learnings, breakdowns, and gotchas. Before starting work,
check what went wrong or was hard-won last time. The goal isn't
caution — it's not re-learning things the hard way.

## Injection

Meta docs are query patterns, not prompts. Each query line below matches items by tag. Matching items are surfaced during `keep now` and `keep get` as contextual information. Lines with trailing `=` (e.g., `project=`) scope results to the viewed item's value for that tag.

Meta docs currently drive query-based surfacing, not LLM prompt construction.
