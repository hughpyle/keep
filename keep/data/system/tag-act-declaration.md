# act: `declaration`

A declarative speech act — changing reality by utterance. Declarations bring new states of affairs into existence. Complete at utterance; the act itself is the change.

Example: "Released v2.0", "Meeting adjourned", "Project cancelled".

## Prompt

The utterance itself changes reality — naming, releasing, cancelling, appointing. Rare in conversation.

YES: "Released v2.0", "Meeting adjourned", "Project cancelled", "I hereby name this..."
NO: "The release is ready" (assertion), "We should cancel the project" (request), "I'll release it tomorrow" (commitment)
