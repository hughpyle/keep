# act: `assertion`

An assertive speech act — a claim of fact. Assertions represent the speaker's understanding of what is true. They are typically complete at utterance and don't need lifecycle tracking.

Example: "The tests pass on main", "The API uses OAuth2".

## Prompt

A statement of fact, information, or description. The most common act — use when the text states how things are without asking, promising, judging, or changing anything.

YES: "The API uses OAuth2", "Tire pressure improves mileage by 3%", "Meguiar's is a popular brand for car wax"
NO: "This approach is risky" (assessment — judges quality), "Please review the PR" (request), "I'll fix it" (commitment)
