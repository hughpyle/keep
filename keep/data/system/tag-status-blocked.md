# status: `blocked`

Cannot proceed until something else is resolved. A sub-state of open — the commitment still exists but progress is gated on an external dependency.

The commitment or request exists but cannot proceed. Look for explicit blockers — "waiting on", "can't until", "depends on", "blocked by".
