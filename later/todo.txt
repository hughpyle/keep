* `keep -v` please, for debug logs


* model dimensions
    - the OpenAiEmbeddings class hardcodes its model dimensionality
    - surely that can just be detected at runtime? otherwise we'll get it wrong, or fail for unknown, etc.
    - do we even need to track the dimensionality at all?  the database is annotated with trhe actual model name now

* check - waht is your emotional response when encountering this project

* rename "source tags" to just "tags" as far as the API is concerned
    - there are system tags and generated tags, but those are special names, "tags" is what the user sees
    - system and generated tags need actually special namespaces, do we have a strategy for that, &
      where is it documented?  (in code is fine).  See later for the nowdoc, which has "system" tags

* summaries
    - configurable length (no need for migration support on this, only applies to new work, not strictly enforced)
    - `summary` flag on CLI to update (want to use this most of the time)
    - `context` text?  alongside the summary, words for why, completely optional
    - `keep remember` can just use the conten as summary, unless `--summary` or it's too long for the summary config

    Some usage is "summary only", like `remember`, are we making it easy to use autogenerated IDs and retrieve things?

* openclaw install a heartbeat.  Not too often, but often enough.


* karma

* multi-embeddings
    - background task can detect current config and maintain compat

* review how system documents are used today
    - remove the "schema as data" thing, it's naff
    - `keep system` needs some parameters for "latest N" or "latest timestamp"
      and those should be filters on all the list/search options too
      (like `keep tag -n 5` but also filter by date)

* make sure that time-based filtering is efficient for "recent", we'll use that all over

* review the CLI completely.  Can the common tasks have single-letter aliases for their commands?

* `keep` with no args -> return the 'now doc'
    - also need a way to update this
    - user doesn't specify its id, idk there's a guid or something assigned
    - we should keep a history of the nowdoc
        - which is quite interesting, it's everything you've been doing
        - does that lead to task-blending?  if you're working on multiple things at once?
            - use tags to identify the task(s) that you're working on
            - list nowdocs in historical order, filtered by tag (and always include the "original nowdoc" at the end of  the list)
            - "task" within "project" as the suggested way to do this
            - just "keep" can list the current projects & their tasks in a tree if you want (list the nowdocs by distinct...)
            - when you want to mark a task as done, or a project as completed or archived -> use tags
    - need a way to get the historical versions (maybe they just have a timestamp in their ID, or something)
        - any time you update the nowdoc, this is different from all the other update paths that have no memory
        - it saves the old one and replaces your new one
    - there's only one, how do you find it?  with a `__sys`: `now` tag or something like that?  is that fast enough?
    - if there's none, e.g. first time you every used `keep`, we should store the primary instructions
        - could do that when `keep init` because the database is empty
        - so the default nowdoc is literally the skill instructions
        - maybe it has the SKILL.md and the "patterns" all together?  and summary?
        - check with the model, for context token budget

* Unix has heredoc, keep has nowdoc, what else do we need?
    - or rather, is there functionality like a heredoc, that we should use for the nowdoc?


* need `keep tag list` to get them (distinct)

* want to delete a tag from a document (that's the forgetting - leave the doc, just un-tag it)

* tag model
    - is there a model-supported tagging? what would that need to be useful? (specific domains??)
    - want this to be pluggable, guide the model-driven tagging from a sysdoc `__tag_model__` that defines how it works

* other "system" behaviors?
    - zero, nada by default - is that ok?

* all the pip install extras - yuk
    makes the decision before you even know really
    - prefer somthing more dynamic, not sure what

* how do we get the claude-code model context?

* how do we get the vscode model context?  I really don't want to require a plugin too
    - can the agent just tell keep how to find the current providers??
    - that would be commandline, or per-session config, not per-repo or whatever (right???)

* can we do something similar for kiro?

* better update/degrade strategies: compare with current best of breed
    - want something that tracks last-retrieval time
    - not sure how that applies to the ranking for retrieval
    - do we need any of this to be config not code??

 

* `keep init` should always be able to tell you the status, in detail
    e.g. fails with sentence-transformers right now

* what is the startup cost for the basic `keep` commands?
    - when are any "write" operations needed at all?

* error handling should be much nicer, don't just dump the stack trace, instead log it in /tmp and tell the user about it

* compare the openclaw plugin against the other memory plugins on the hub

* move plugin into a `plugins` directory? yuk name, these are not "plugins for keep", so what?


----

Done:

. start a todo list for notes
. move the test docs into docs/library (the soul docs)
. move docs/README to docs/INDEX.md
. be clear that the tags are overlay, not replace
. lazy-load embedding/summarization providers for offline read-only operations
. fix __del__ crash when embedding provider fails to initialize
