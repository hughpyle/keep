# keep daemon

Manage the background daemon and its work queues.

For directly running the daemon in the foreground, use `keepd --store PATH`.

## Usage

```bash
keep daemon                   # Start the daemon and process work
keep daemon --list            # Show queue status + active mirrors
keep daemon --reindex         # Enqueue all notes for re-embedding, then show progress
keep daemon --retry           # Reset failed items back to pending, then show progress
keep daemon --purge           # Delete all pending work items
keep daemon --stop            # Stop the daemon

keepd --store ~/.keep         # Direct foreground daemon runner
```

## What it does

`keep daemon` starts the background daemon and processes queued work:
embedding, summarization, analysis, OCR, link extraction, and edge
processing.

`keepd` is the smallest direct entrypoint when you want to run the daemon
explicitly in the foreground. `keep daemon` is the full CLI management
command.

The daemon also services:

- **File and directory watches** registered via `keep put --watch`
- **Markdown sync mirrors** registered via `keep data export --sync`
- **Timer-driven background work** such as replenishment and retry cycles

When there's no work and no active watches or mirrors, the daemon exits after an idle timeout.

## Flags

### `--list` / `-l`

Show the current state of the work queue without starting the daemon:

```bash
keep daemon --list
```

Output includes:
- Pending, processing, and failed item counts
- Active markdown mirrors with their status
- Whether the daemon is running

### `--reindex`

Enqueue every note in the store for re-embedding. Use this after changing embedding providers or models, or to rebuild the search index from scratch:

```bash
keep daemon --reindex
```

This queues work and then shows progress. You can also let an existing daemon
pick it up.

### `--retry`

Reset failed items back to pending so they'll be retried:

```bash
keep daemon --retry
```

Useful after fixing a transient issue (e.g., a provider was down, Ollama wasn't running) that caused items to fail.

### `--purge`

Delete all pending work items from the queue:

```bash
keep daemon --purge
```

Use with care — this discards queued work permanently. Items that were already processed are unaffected.

### `--stop`

Stop the background daemon:

```bash
keep daemon --stop
```

Sends SIGTERM and waits up to 10 seconds for graceful shutdown. If the daemon is stuck, it falls back to SIGKILL. Also cleans up stale discovery files (port, token, PID).

## Markdown mirrors

When markdown sync mirrors are registered (`keep data export --sync`), the
daemon services them automatically. `keep daemon` and `keep daemon --list`
report the number of active mirrors:

```
Markdown mirrors active: 1
```

Mirror state (last run, pending changes, errors) is visible via:

```bash
keep data export --list
```

See [keep data](KEEP-DATA.md) for full sync documentation.

## Common workflows

### After import

```bash
keep data import backup.json
keep daemon                     # Process embeddings for imported notes
```

### After changing embedding provider

```bash
keep config --setup             # Change provider
keep daemon --reindex           # Queue re-embedding for all notes
keep daemon                     # Process
```

### Troubleshooting failed items

```bash
keep daemon --list              # Check for failed items
keep daemon --retry             # Reset them to pending
keep daemon                     # Reprocess
```

### Restarting the daemon

```bash
keep daemon --stop
keep daemon                     # Fresh start
```
