## Global Flags

```bash
keep --json <cmd>        # Output as JSON (supported by most commands)
keep --ids <cmd>         # Output only IDs, one per line (for piping)
keep --full <cmd>        # Output full notes with context (overrides --ids)
keep -v <cmd>            # Enable debug logging to stderr
```

`--json`, `--ids`, and `--full` control output format globally. `--ids` is useful for shell composition (`keep find --ids foo | xargs keep get`). `--full` expands each result with frontmatter context. These are mutually exclusive; `--full` takes precedence over `--ids`.

## Output Formats

Two output formats, consistent across all commands:

### Default: Summary Lines
One line per note: `id date summary` (search results include score: `id (score) date summary`)
```
%a1b2c3d4         2026-01-14 URI detection should use proper scheme validation...
%e5f6a7b8         (0.89) 2026-01-14 OAuth2 token refresh pattern...
file:///path/doc  2026-01-15 Document about authentication patterns...
```

### With `--json`: JSON Output
```json
{"id": "...", "summary": "...", "tags": {...}, "score": 0.823}
```

Version numbers are **selectors**: @V{0} = current, @V{1} = previous, @V{2} = two versions ago, @V{-1} = oldest archived, @V{-2} = second-oldest.
Part numbers are **1-indexed**: @P{1} = first part, @P{2} = second part, etc.

**Output width:** Summaries are truncated to fit the terminal. When stdout is not a TTY (e.g., piped through hooks), output uses 200 columns for wider summaries.

### Pipe Composition

```bash
keep find "auth" --json | ...                        # Process search results
keep list -l 5 --json | ...                          # Process recent notes

# Version history composition
diff <(keep get doc:1) <(keep get "doc:1@V{1}")      # Diff current vs previous
```

## Quick CLI

```bash

## When to Use
- `put` / `put(uri=...)` — when referencing any file/URL worth remembering
- `put` / `put("text")` — capture conversation insights, decisions, notes
- `find` — before searching filesystem; may already be indexed
- `find --since` — filter to recent notes when recency matters
