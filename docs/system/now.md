# Now

This is top-of-mind right now.  Reminders for essential practice.
(Keep this updated as you need)

**Before acting:**
- Where are we in the conversation?
- What do I know? `keep now`
- What else is skillful? `keep find ...`

**After acting:**
- What happened? `keep remember "what I learned" -t context=learning`
- What do I save? `keep update`
- What now? `keep now "Current focus: ..."`
