# Prompts

keep uses three families of prompt docs, all stored under `.prompt/`:

| Family | IDs | Used by |
|--------|-----|---------|
| `.prompt/summarize/` | `default`, `conversation`, ... | `keep put` (summarization) |
| `.prompt/analyze/` | `default`, `conversation`, ... | `keep analyze` (decomposition) |
| `.prompt/agent/` | `reflect`, `query`, `conversation`, `session-start`, ... | `keep prompt` CLI and `keep_prompt` MCP tool |

Summarize and analyze prompts replace the LLM system prompt for their respective operations. Agent prompts are rendered with context injection and returned as text — see [KEEP-PROMPT.md](KEEP-PROMPT.md) for the CLI and [KEEP-MCP.md](KEEP-MCP.md) for the MCP tool.

## Summarize and analyze prompts

Each summarize/analyze prompt doc has two parts:

1. **Match rules** — tag queries that determine when this prompt applies (same DSL as `.meta/*` docs)
2. **`## Prompt` section** — the actual system prompt text sent to the LLM

When a document is summarized or analyzed, keep scans the matching `.prompt/{type}/` docs, finds those whose match rules match the document's tags, and selects the most specific match (most rules matched). The `## Prompt` section from the winner replaces the default system prompt.

### Bundled

| ID | Match rule | Purpose |
|----|-----------|---------|
| `.prompt/summarize/default` | *(none — fallback)* | Default summarization prompt |
| `.prompt/summarize/conversation` | `type=conversation` | Preserves dates, names, facts from conversations |
| `.prompt/analyze/default` | *(none — fallback)* | Default analysis prompt for structural decomposition |
| `.prompt/analyze/conversation` | `type=conversation` | Fact extraction from conversations |

### Creating custom prompts

Create a new prompt doc with match rules targeting specific tags:

```bash
# Custom summarization for code documentation
keep put "$(cat <<'EOF'
topic=code

## Prompt

Summarize this code documentation in under 200 words.
Focus on: what the API does, key parameters, return values, and common pitfalls.
Begin with the function or class name.
EOF
)" --id .prompt/summarize/code
```

Match rules can combine multiple tags for higher specificity:

```bash
# Prompt for meeting notes in a specific project
keep put "$(cat <<'EOF'
type=meeting project=myapp

## Prompt

Summarize this meeting in under 300 words.
Focus on decisions made, action items assigned, and deadlines mentioned.
List each action item with its owner.
EOF
)" --id .prompt/summarize/myapp-meetings
```

The most specific match wins — a prompt matching `type=meeting project=myapp` (2 rules) beats one matching just `type=meeting` (1 rule), which beats the default (0 rules).

## Agent prompts

Agent prompts live at `.prompt/agent/` and contain template placeholders (`{get}`, `{find}`, `{text}`) that are expanded with store context at render time. They are returned as text for the calling agent to follow — not sent to an LLM as a system prompt.

```bash
keep prompt reflect                      # Render the reflect prompt
keep prompt reflect "auth flow"          # With search context injected
keep prompt --list                       # List available agent prompts
```

See [KEEP-PROMPT.md](KEEP-PROMPT.md) for full usage and template placeholders.

## Viewing prompt docs

```bash
keep get .prompt/summarize/default       # See a summarize/analyze prompt
keep get .prompt/agent/reflect           # See an agent prompt
keep list .prompt                        # All prompt docs
```

Prompt docs are editable and versioned like any other store document.
