# Tagging

Tags are key-value pairs attached to every item. They enable filtering, organization, and commitment tracking.

**One value per key.** Setting a tag overwrites any existing value for that key.

## Setting tags

```bash
keep put "note" -t project=myapp -t topic=auth    # On create
keep now "working on auth" -t project=myapp        # On now update
keep tag-update ID --tag key=value                 # Add/update tag on existing item
keep tag-update ID --remove key                    # Remove a tag
keep tag-update ID1 ID2 --tag status=done          # Tag multiple items
```

## Tag merge order

When indexing documents, tags are merged in this order (later wins):

1. **Existing tags** — preserved from previous version
2. **Config tags** — from `[tags]` section in `keep.toml`
3. **Environment tags** — from `KEEP_TAG_*` variables
4. **User tags** — passed via `-t` on the command line

### Environment variable tags

Set tags via environment variables with the `KEEP_TAG_` prefix:

```bash
export KEEP_TAG_PROJECT=myapp
export KEEP_TAG_OWNER=alice
keep put "deployment note"    # auto-tagged with project=myapp, owner=alice
```

### Config-based default tags

Add a `[tags]` section to `keep.toml`:

```toml
[tags]
project = "my-project"
owner = "alice"
required = ["user"]                    # Enforce required tags on put()
namespace_keys = ["category", "user"]  # LangGraph namespace mapping
```

The `required` list enforces that specified tag keys must be present on every `put()` call. The `namespace_keys` list configures how LangGraph namespace components map to tag names — see [LANGCHAIN-INTEGRATION.md](LANGCHAIN-INTEGRATION.md).

## Tag filtering

The `-t` flag filters results on `find`, `list`, `get`, and `now`:

```bash
keep find "auth" -t project=myapp          # Semantic search + tag filter
keep find "auth" -t project -t topic=auth  # Multiple tags (AND logic)
keep list --tag project=myapp              # List items with tag
keep list --tag project                    # Any item with 'project' tag
keep get ID -t project=myapp              # Error if item doesn't match
keep now -t project=myapp                 # Find now version with tag
```

## Listing tags

```bash
keep list --tags=                    # List all distinct tag keys
keep list --tags=project             # List all values for 'project' tag
```

## Organizing by project and topic

Two tags help organize work across boundaries:

| Tag | Scope | Examples |
|-----|-------|----------|
| `project` | Bounded work context | `myapp`, `api-v2`, `migration` |
| `topic` | Cross-project subject area | `auth`, `testing`, `performance` |

```bash
# Project-specific knowledge
keep put "OAuth2 with PKCE chosen" -t project=myapp -t topic=auth

# Cross-project knowledge (topic only)
keep put "Token refresh needs clock sync" -t topic=auth

# Search within a project
keep find "authentication" -t project=myapp

# Search across projects by topic
keep find "authentication" -t topic=auth
```

For more on these conventions: `keep get .tag/project` and `keep get .tag/topic`.
For domain-specific organization patterns: `keep get .domains`.

## Tag-based isolation

Tags on `find` are **pre-filters on the vector search**, not post-filters. When you search with `-t user=alice`, the similarity search only considers notes tagged `user=alice` — you get the best matches *within that scope*, not global results filtered afterward. This makes tags suitable for data isolation.

**Pattern: scoped search with `required_tags`**

```toml
# keep.toml
[tags]
required = ["user"]
```

With this config, every `put()` must include a `user` tag (or it raises `ValueError`). Pair it with tag filters on every search to get per-user isolation:

```python
kp.put("my note", tags={"user": "alice"})         # enforced by required_tags
kp.find("auth", tags={"user": "alice"})            # only searches alice's notes
```

```bash
keep put "my note" -t user=alice
keep find "auth" -t user=alice           # scoped to alice
```

**Note:** `required_tags` enforces tags on writes only. The caller is responsible for passing the same tag filter on reads. Without the filter, `find` searches across all notes.

This pattern works for any isolation key — `user`, `project`, `tenant`, `session`, etc. The [LangChain integration](LANGCHAIN-INTEGRATION.md) automates this: namespace components become tags on both writes and searches.

## Speech-act tags

Two tags — `act` and `status` — make the commitment structure of work visible. These are **constrained tags**: only pre-defined values are accepted.

```bash
# Track a commitment
keep put "I'll fix the auth bug" -t act=commitment -t status=open -t project=myapp

# Query open commitments and requests
keep list -t act=commitment -t status=open
keep list -t act=request -t status=open

# Mark fulfilled
keep tag-update ID --tag status=fulfilled

# Record an assertion or assessment (no lifecycle)
keep put "The tests pass" -t act=assertion
keep put "This approach is risky" -t act=assessment -t topic=architecture
```

For inline reference: `keep get .tag/act` and `keep get .tag/status`.

## Tag descriptions (`.tag/*`)

Every tag key can have a description document at `.tag/KEY`. These are installed automatically on first use and serve as living documentation:

```bash
keep get .tag/act       # Speech-act categories
keep get .tag/status    # Lifecycle status values
keep get .tag/type      # Content type values
keep get .tag/project   # Project tag conventions
keep get .tag/topic     # Topic tag conventions
```

Tag descriptions have their own summary and embedding, so they participate in semantic search. They also contain structured information that the analyzer uses when auto-tagging parts during `keep analyze`.

### Constrained values

Some tags are **constrained** — only pre-defined values are accepted. When a `.tag/KEY` document has `_constrained: true` in its tags, keep validates that every value you assign has a corresponding sub-document at `.tag/KEY/VALUE`.

```bash
keep put "note" -t act=commitment     # ✓ .tag/act/commitment exists
keep put "note" -t act=blurb          # ✗ ValueError: no .tag/act/blurb
```

The error message lists valid values:

```
Invalid value for constrained tag 'act': 'blurb'. Valid values: assertion, assessment, commitment, declaration, offer, request
```

You can extend constrained tags by creating new sub-documents:

```bash
keep put "Active work in progress." --id .tag/status/working
# Now status=working is accepted
```

### Bundled tag descriptions

keep ships with these tag descriptions:

| Tag | Constrained | Values | Purpose |
|-----|:-----------:|--------|---------|
| `act` | Yes | `commitment`, `request`, `offer`, `assertion`, `assessment`, `declaration` | Speech-act category (what the speaker is doing) |
| `status` | Yes | `open`, `blocked`, `fulfilled`, `declined`, `withdrawn`, `renegotiated` | Lifecycle state of commitments/requests/offers |
| `type` | No | `learning`, `breakdown`, `gotcha`, `reference`, `teaching`, `meeting`, `pattern`, `possibility`, `decision` | Content classification |
| `project` | No | (user-defined) | Bounded work context |
| `topic` | No | (user-defined) | Cross-cutting subject area |

Constrained tags (`act`, `status`) also have individual sub-documents (e.g., `.tag/act/commitment`, `.tag/status/open`) that describe each value in detail.

Unconstrained tags (`type`, `project`, `topic`) accept any value. Their descriptions document conventions but don't enforce them.

Some tags also define **edges** — navigable relationships between documents. See [EDGE-TAGS.md](EDGE-TAGS.md) for details.

### How tag docs are injected into LLM prompts

Tag descriptions feed into analysis through two independent paths:

#### 1. Guide context (all tags)

When you pass `-t` to `keep analyze`, the full content of each `.tag/KEY` document is prepended to the analysis prompt as context. This guides the LLM's decomposition — how it splits content into parts and what boundaries it recognizes.

```bash
keep analyze doc:1 -t topic -t project
```

This fetches `.tag/topic` and `.tag/project` descriptions and includes them in the analysis prompt, producing better part boundaries and more consistent tagging. Any tag doc participates in guide context, whether constrained or not.

#### 2. Classification (constrained tags only)

After decomposition, a second LLM pass classifies each part. The `TagClassifier` loads all constrained tag descriptions (those with `_constrained: true`) and assembles a classification prompt from their `## Prompt` sections:

- The **parent doc's** `## Prompt` section (e.g., from `.tag/act`) provides overall guidance for the tag key
- Each **value sub-doc's** `## Prompt` section (e.g., from `.tag/act/commitment`) describes when to assign that specific value

The classifier assigns tags only when confidence exceeds the threshold (default 0.7). Tags without a `## Prompt` section use their full content as a fallback description.

To customize classification behavior, edit the `## Prompt` section in a tag doc — the classifier only sees `## Prompt` content, not the surrounding documentation.

## System tags

Tags prefixed with `_` are protected and auto-managed. Users cannot set them directly.

**Implemented:** `_created`, `_updated`, `_updated_date`, `_accessed`, `_accessed_date`, `_content_type`, `_source`

kp.tag("doc:1", {"status": "reviewed"})      # Add/update tag
kp.tag("doc:1", {"obsolete": ""})            # Delete tag (empty string)
kp.list_items(tags={"project": "myapp"})      # Exact key=value match
kp.list_items(tag_keys=["project"])           # Any doc with 'project' tag
kp.list_tags()                               # All distinct tag keys
kp.list_tags("project")                      # All values for 'project'
```
